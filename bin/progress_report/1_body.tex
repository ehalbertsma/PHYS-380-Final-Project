\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Group members} This project will involve myself, Emrys Halbertsma, as the sole group member. 
    \item \textbf{Topic} The topic of this literature review revolves around Beetroot juice supplementation in elite runners. Beetroot juice has received some media hype in recent years due to a supposed performance-enhancing effect. Some sources report that this supplement is ineffective in elite runners, but may offer benefit to recreational runners. This literature review will explore potential reasons why one group of runners benefits more than the other, if at all.
