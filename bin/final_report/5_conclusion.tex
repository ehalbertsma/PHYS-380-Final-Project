\chapter{Conclusion}
As part of this project, we have derived the wave equation from the equation of motion and evaluated a plane wave approximate solution as well as a spherical wave solution. We also investigated how each of these solutions interact at the interface between two media.

We then attempted to compute these solutions to demonstrate visually the governance of Snell's law in layered media, but we could not get a solution on time. We spent a large sum of time trying to work with \href{https://fenicsproject.org/}{FEniCS} in order to find spherical and planar numerical solutions to the wave equation, to no avail.

A next step in modelling the propagation of $p$-wave would require:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Completing a graphical analysis of spherical and planar waves traveling through layered media
    \item Providing an in-depth analysis of the effects of density as well as Lam√© coefficients in the propagation of these waves
    \item Studying the effects of non-planar interfaces between layered media and assert their importance based on Earth's composition
    \item Moving towards an increased number of media as a first step to continuous differences
\end{itemize}

All in all, we are glad to have chosen this topic but disappointed we weren't able to delve deeper into it especially in the computational section.
